# HilbertModularFormsCubic
Cubic field implementation of Hilbert Modular Form in Magma, previously found in edgarcosta/hilbertmodularforms.

For the most up to date implementation of HMFs over quadratic fields, see edgarcosta/hilbertmodularforms.

To test roots of period polynomials, load config.m, then run PeriodPolynomialsHMF.m.
